<h1>About me</h1>

<p>
    Iâ€™m a Software Engineer with a mechanical engineering background.
    Before the software engineering I worked in the production of stadiums and unique buildings around the world.
    I have over 5 years of experience in this field. I also have a master's degree in mechanical engineering and know almost everything about metal cutting processes.

    I would like to share my biggest mechanical engineering projects, which I am proud of.

                Volgograd Arena is a stadium for the 2018 local football championship in Russia.
                During this project I was responsible for machanical operations.
                The most difficult in terms of machining were the beams of the compression ring, which served as a support for the unique cable-stayed roof of the stadium.
                The complexity of these beams was in the high quality requirements, namely, the tolerance for the length was 16000 0/+1 mm and the tolerance for the angle of the processed surface to the beam axis was &#177;0.25&#176;.
                During production, a virtual assembly of these beams was also made in order to identify the actual dimensions of the ring.
                As a result, all the beams were assembled during the installation of the object without a single problem
