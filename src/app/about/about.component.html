<h1>About me</h1>

<p>
    Iâ€™m a Software Engineer with a mechanical engineering background.
    Before the software engineering I worked in the production of stadiums and unique buildings around the world.
    I have over 5 years of experience in this field. I also have a master's degree in mechanical engineering and know almost everything about metal cutting processes.

    I would like to share my previous mechanical engineering projects, which I am proud of.
