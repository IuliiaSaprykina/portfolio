    <h1>About me</h1>
    
    <p>
        I’m a Software Engineer with a mechanical engineering background.
        Before the software engineering I worked in the production of stadiums and unique buildings around the world.
        I have over 5 years of experience in this field. I also have a master's degree in mechanical engineering and know almost everything about metal cutting processes.

        I would like to share my biggest mechanical engineering projects, which I am proud of.

                Volgograd Arena is a stadium for the 2018 local football championship in Russia.
                During this project I was responsible for machanical operations.
                The most difficult in terms of machining were the beams of the compression ring, which served as a support for the unique cable-stayed roof of the stadium.
                The complexity of these beams was in the high quality requirements, namely, the tolerance for the length was 16000 0/+1 mm and the tolerance for the angle of the processed surface to the beam axis was &#177;0.25&#176;.
                During production, a virtual assembly of these beams was also made in order to identify the actual dimensions of the ring.
                As a result, all the beams were assembled during the installation of the object without a single problem.

                I worked on my master's project for 1.5 years. There was a big project for the production of a differential carrier.
                During this project, the following main goals were achieved: <br>
                    1. Developed technological documentation for the "Left differential carrier" allows to reduce the time for preparation of production by 30%. <br>
                    2. The developed CNC program in software NX10 Siemens with the help of visualization of the mechanical process eliminates the possibility of collision between the tool and the workpiece during machining. 
                    During the development this CNC program the iMachinning principle was applied. 
                    iMachining allows generate CNC programs that will adhere to the principles of HSM (high speed machining), enabling much shorter machining time, longer tool life.<br>
                Here is the visualization of machanical process.
